        <li>
            <p>
                Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, 
                until soft, 10–12 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, about 3 minutes. Add 
                red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Increase heat to medium, add 
                puréed tomatoes, and season lightly with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until 
                sauce thickens slightly and flavors have come together, 20–25 minutes. Remove 
                from heat and stir in basil.

                Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, 
                until very al dente (about 2 minutes before it would be done). Drain, 
                reserving ½ cup pasta cooking liquid.

            <p>
                As soon as pasta is ready, pluck out and discard basil. Set skillet over 
                high heat and stir in reserved pasta cooking liquid to loosen sauce; bring 
                to a boil. Add pasta and cook, stirring, until sauce coats pasta and pasta 
                is al dente, about 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat. Add butter and Parmesan 
                and toss until butter and cheese are melted. Divide pasta among bowls.
