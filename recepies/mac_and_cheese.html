                Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir 
                in macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, 
                until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and transfer pasta to 
                a slow cooker.
